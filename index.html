            <h2>about me</h2>
            <p>i'm a one to two year old german shepherd & belgian malinois mix. i love other doggies, LOVE going on long walks and runs, and am the biggest cuddler you could find. i'm SUPER food motivated, so teaching me tricks is not too hard - and i'm pretty smart, even if i do say so myself. my foster family says i'm a bit of a handful, but i always come when called, i can sit, and am potty trained. </p>
            <p>i love playing fetch, and i have a new found love of any and all toys. my favorites are squeaky stuffed animals, like the pink bunny kong i'm holding onto in the picture. i might grab a slipper or two if you leave it lying around, but don't worry, i'm very gentle with them and would never rip them up! </p>
            <p>i love my family so much that it's hard to keep it contained - i still like to jump on them, but i'm working on stopping</p>
            <p>i'm on the hunt for my forever home, and promise to be the best friend you've ever had. that said, it's important you understand that i'm definitely a lot of work. i shed a lot, and require a lot of exercise and mental stimulation. i like meeting new people, but i'm a little wary at first because of my history, so make sure you're patient with me at first. i would love to come home with you, but please make sure you've done your research on my breed first, because we can be a lot for first time dog owners!</p>
            <p>i love rolling around in the grass and am super curious. i have the sweetest demeanor ever.</p>
